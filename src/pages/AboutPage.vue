        On the site, you will find various recipes taken from an external API called spoonacular.
        <br/>
        You can search for the recipe both as users and as guests, in the search you can filter by a variety of options.
        <br/>
        For a logged in user there is the option to create a personal recipe, save recipes in favorites, view personal and family recipes.
        <br/>
        For each recipe on the site you will know if it is vegan, vegetarian, gluten free and more.
        <br/>
        Hope you enjoy :)
